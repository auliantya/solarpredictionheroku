#### Project Background 
Solar radiation is electromagnetic radiation coming from the sun, sometimes known as sunlight or solar resources. The balance between the solar radiation captivated by the earth and the energy it escapes to space determines the climate. The atmosphere, continents, and seas absorb a portion of the solar energy. According to research, solar energy is one of the leading crucial forms of energy that has the potential to provide extra energy to the earth in the next few decades to come.  

In Malaysia, the average daily solar radiation in a month in Malaysia is between 4,000 and 5,000 amounts of falling solar energy per unit at a stated time, shortly expressed as Wh/m2. The monthly average of sunshine is four to eight hours or about 2,300 hours on yearly basis in Malaysia. When it comes to collecting solar energy, creating a high-precision solar energy prediction is required to create an effective and efficient power grid operation (Izadyar et al., 2016). Solar radiation prediction has long been a hot issue in renewable energy. Prediction aids in the development and management of solar systems provide several economic benefits to power companies (Alzahrani et al., 2017). Solar radiation estimation predicts solar radiation transients and solar energy system generation, enabling the establishment of contingency measures to reduce any departure from the needed output for power plants.

#### App Purpose
This app aims to enable forecast of the solar radiation in Malaysia using Support Vector Machine (SVM)through meteorological data.

#### Algorithm Details
SVM is a type of support vector machine that can be used for both linear and non-linear regression problems. It works by finding a boundary that maximizes the margin between the data points and the boundary.
